JAY_PORTFOLIO_OF_PROJECTS 


An overview of the steps required to complete a stock prediction project using LSTM and Jupyter Notebook. Here's a general outline:

1.Data Collection: Collect historical stock price data for the company you want to predict. You can use various APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage to obtain stock data.

2.Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data. This can include handling missing values, scaling the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

3.Building the LSTM model: Build an LSTM model using Keras or Tensorflow. This involves specifying the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions.

4.Training the model: Train the LSTM model on the training data. This involves specifying the number of epochs and batch size.

5.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing data. This involves computing metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE) or mean absolute error (MAE).

6.Making Predictions: Use the trained LSTM model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

7.This project is about building a stock price prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The goal of the project is to take the historical stock price data of any company and predict its future stock prices. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that can learn from and make predictions on sequences of data, making it suitable for predicting time series data like stock prices.



The project involves several steps, including:

1.Preprocessing the historical stock price data by selecting the relevant features, normalizing the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

2.Building an LSTM model using Keras or Tensorflow libraries in Python.

3.Training the LSTM model on the training data and evaluating its performance on the testing data.

4.Making predictions on the new or unseen data using the trained LSTM model.

5.Visualizing the predicted stock prices and comparing them with the actual stock prices.

This project can help investors and traders in making informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks based on the predicted future prices. However, it is important to note that the stock market is highly unpredictable, and any predictions made by the model should be taken with caution and verified with other sources of information
